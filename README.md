# Prework-Study-Guide Intro

## Discription

I will be using this application as a bootcamp student to study material and knowledge gained from the duration of this course. Continuing to add bits of information will definitely give me a step up in my coding career.

- My motivation for completing this task as well as taking the course as a whole is because it intrigues me the amount of things someone can acomplish as a developer.
- I built this project for my own benifit as it pertains to studying and just learning more in general. 
- It keeps me organized and remembering all the things I have trouble remembering involving code.
- I learned a TON, CSS is super interesting; I used to do graphic design and the fact that you can customize anything electronically through code is crazy. Javascript is a little scary, however I am super excited to learn a little more with that language as well.
